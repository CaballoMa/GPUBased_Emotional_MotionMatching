## Motion Matching Introduction

Motion matching is a data-driven animation technique used predominantly in video games and virtual reality to achieve lifelike character movements. Departing from traditional handcrafted animations, motion matching relies on a vast database of motion capture data. In real-time, the system queries and selects relevant motion data based on the current state and user input, seamlessly blending and adapting animations for a more realistic and dynamic appearance. This approach enhances adaptability to environmental changes, reduces repetitiveness, and contributes to a more immersive and engaging user experience by creating responsive and authentic character animations.

Traditional Motion matching is CPU-based, and usually only runs on the main character. Our approach uses a GPU-based method to speed up the process and make it more suitable for multi-character motion-matching conditions.
